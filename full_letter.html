        <h1>Full Letter to Cess</h1>
        <p>Dear Cess,</p>
        <p>It’s funny how life works, sometimes it's serious and sometimes it's not. I never thought I’d be writing this kind of letter to you, but here I am, and honestly, I wouldn’t have it any other way; hiding my feelings, can't express them properly, and don't know what to do anymore, I must be going sanity again. I wanted to start by looking back, at how I met you and how, little by little, I got to know you more. The first time we met feels like a blur now, but what stood out to me up until now is how naturally you make people feel comfortable. First time I met you, I can tell that you'll be a great leader, our special Mayor that is like an Angel blessing us everyday. As time passed, we started to get to know each other, began sharing moments with one another, I saw more of who you are: someone who’s thoughtful, funny, and full of life even if you don't feel well sometimes. It’s actually these little things about you, Cess, that have left a mark on me. Your actions, gestures, everything.</p>
        <p>Before our Christmas Party, we began picking papers to whoever we get, we'll buy their wishlist. At first, I thought that there's no way I'll be picking you in just one touch. When you reach out to me, I put my hand in your jacket I found that your hand was there too, holding something. I don't know what's come to me but I've chosen to get the paper out of your hand. Well who knows, I didn't expect that I got your paper wishlist, I was shocked but silently, I was like going insane! I've think a lot of things, did Cess plan it out? Why was she holding her paper? Or is it just me overthinking? But whatever it might be, I just didn't focus on it. Your wish list contains: thing that reminds you of me, perfume (sweet/baby scent) and a hair clamp.I actually didn't know what to choose to, we've had an incident where I broke your hair clamp and I'm really sorry Cess about that one. I actually wanted to choose everything but instead I chose two: hair clamp and one thing that reminds you of me.</p>
        <p>This Christmas party, I wanted my gift to be something that could bring you comfort, something unique, just like you. "Thing that reminds you of me," yes, so, I chose Chimmy, the BT21 stuffed toy, you’re free to name it however you like. I chose Chimmy because it reminded me of how cheerful you are, your look, and it's really cute just like you. What makes Chimmy special isn't just about that but the horizontal opening in the middle. You can slip your hand through it and lay your head on it whenever you feel down or unwell, Cess. Yes, It’s not just a toy, to me it’s a reminder. I hope that even if I'm away, I couldn't be there for you to lay your head on my shoulder, even if we're far apart from each other, Chimmy can be a small way to remind you of me and how much I care about you.</p>
        <p>So, as this year comes to an end, I want to give you something more than just a gift. I hope that this letter and Chimmy can bring you a moment of joy and remind you to take the time to enjoy this Christmas season with your family. Cess, you deserve all the happiness this holiday has to offer, and I’m grateful I get to share even a small part of it with you.</p>
        <p>Thank you and Merry Christmas, Cess! Here’s to more moments, more stories, and maybe even more surprises ahead that might happen to us in the future.</p>
        <p>Yours,<br>Ongchinke.</p>
